## What's New (User Facing) 
* Improved User Dashboard: Both admin and volunteer dashboards have been updated with new features, including task assignment and volunteer visibility.
* Enhanced User Experience: New functionalities such as task completion logging and a dedicated volunteer view have been added to streamline user interaction.
* Deployment and Content Updates: The application is now fully deployed on Vercel
## Work Summary (Developer Facing) 
In this sprint, we focused on implementing key features and functionality that improve the overall system. We completed the integration of task assignment and notifications, ensuring that tasks are effectively assigned and tracked across the platform, with clear notifications for users. We also worked on logging task completion, which provides a way to track and document progress. For the admin and volunteer dashboard, we successfully added the volunteer list, allowing for better visibility and management of volunteers. Additionally, we focused on improving system reliability, addressing any issues that arose during deployment, and making sure the platform remains stable. The development of the volunteer view feature was completed, offering a more intuitive interface for volunteers to interact with. To ensure code quality, we implemented unit test functions, verifying that all key system components function as expected. In terms of content, we added a report draft and FAQ sections, providing valuable information to users and enhancing the siteâ€™s utility. Finally, we worked on integrating site images related to GCISL and resolved deployment issues, ensuring smooth and successful deployment on Vercel. Throughout this sprint, we addressed various front-end and back-end challenges, solidifying our ability to manage a full-stack application and deploy it effectively.
## Unfinished Work  
* Fix Window Sizing - Window resizing was not fully addressed due to time constraints. This will be prioritized in the next sprint to ensure a responsive design across all screen sizes.
* Logs/Reporting Pages - Logs and reporting functionalities were not finalized as the team focused on core system integrations and features.

## Retrospective Summary   
Here's what went well: 
 * Updated admin and volunteer view (task assignment, task notifications, volunteer list)
 * Connected tasks and volunteers successfully to MongoDB
 * Corrected Deployment Issues to match our local code
Here's what we'd like to improve: 
  * We should get better at having 2+ lines with in depth descriptions for our commits
  * We should get better at creating a pull request for our all our commits and associate them with our issues
  * We should, as individual team member, get better at making comments on our teammates pull request and mention potential areas to improve each other code quality and functionality
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint: 
  * Fix windows sizing so that mobile, web and everything between makes sense
  * Completing/Creating the Logs/Report pages
  * Any other issues our client finds
