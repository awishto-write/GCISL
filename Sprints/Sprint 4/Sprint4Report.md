## What's New (User Facing) 
* Enhanced Task Management: Users can now filter tasks by status, and multiple assignees see synchronized updates.


* Improved Logs & Reporting: Users can delete log entries with a click and filter logs by due date for better organization.
* Contact & UI Enhancements: The Contact Us form now links to Google Forms with a "Reason" field, and dashboard selection highlighting has been improved.
## Work Summary (Developer Facing) 
During this sprint, our team focused on enhancing the user experience and improving backend functionality. We tackled several frontend enhancements, such as refining the Contact Us and Get Involved pages, implementing log filtering, and improving task management features. Backend efforts included fixing API endpoint issues and refining task data handling. One of the main challenges we faced was ensuring consistency when handling tasks with multiple assignees, which required refining our status update logic. Additionally, we worked through technical debt by adding success messages, refining UI aesthetics, and implementing dashboard selection highlights. This sprint reinforced the importance of clear communication between frontend and backend teams, especially when modifying API structures and ensuring seamless user interactions.
## Unfinished Work  
* Research Involvement Page - The research page has been implemented yet because the team has not received any content or clear information from the client.
* Dark mode and light mode switch - Dark mode functionality  was not finalized as the team focused on core system integrations and features.
* Fix Window Sizing - Window resizing was not fully addressed due to time constraints. This will be prioritized in the next sprint to ensure a responsive design across all screen sizes.
