## What's New (User Facing)
* Enhanced Get Involved Page – Improved layout and content for better engagement.
* Fixed Window Sizing (for all platforms) – Ensured consistent display across different screen sizes.
* Created and Finished Research Page – Developed a fully functional Research page for users to access relevant information.
## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
During this sprint, we enhanced user-facing features and improved backend functionality. Key frontend updates included refining the Get Involved page, fixing window sizing issues for better cross-platform compatibility, and implementing the Research page. On the backend, we resolved API endpoint issues, improved data handling, and added test coverage to ensure system reliability. These improvements contribute to a more stable and user-friendly experience while strengthening the overall architecture of our system.
