# Sprint x Report (8/05/24 - 10/05/2024)

## What's New (User Facing)

 * Successful deployment on Vercel
 * Refactoring of Pages

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

In this sprint, we worked on the projection description, requirement and specifications section of the project. We met with clients and the professor in order to understand our tasks and how we should approach the slack of directions.Each member was assigned a task to complete during and after our meetings. Our work was a little delayed because the main admin client was absent for some time. However, we recently were able to meet with her and better understand the current state of the application and their needs. After further communications with the clients, we realized that the application has never been used by them and at this moment is not even working, beside displaying static information such as the organization vision and mission. We are still discussing possible features ideas for the system and working on getting familiar with the back end tools we will be using for the dynamic portion of the site. Also, we shared with the clients the current site and asked them for feedback to improve the front end as well.

## Unfinished Work

Currently, we do not have any unfinished work in this sprint because we did not start implementing any features.

## Retrospective Summary
Here's what went well:
  * We have all completed our required certificates
  * We have successfully hosted and deployed the site on Vercel
  * We have transitioned from ElephantSQL to MongoDB
 
Here's what we'd like to improve:
  * We should meet with other (team member) regularly during the week to discuss about the project and check each other progress
  * We should understand more what the organization does, so we can help them better
  
Here are changes we plan to implement in the next sprint:
  * We plan to start working on the implementation of the features/issues
  * We plan to gather more ideas relative to more tools to use 
  * We plan to discuss with the client as soon as we finish a feature, so that we can make potential changes as soon as possible when needed.
